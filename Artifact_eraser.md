## Discussion and Reflection

In this section, the team must provide a critical analysis of the design and implementation carried out
during the project. The goal is not only to describe what was done, but also to reason about why
decisions were made, evaluate the effectiveness of the solution, and assess how well the system
demonstrates cloud-native principles.

The discussion should include the following elements:

 - **Design Rationale**
 - **Implementation Challenges**
 - **Cloud-Native Principles Evaluation**
 - **Effectiveness of the Process**
 - **Lessons Learned**
